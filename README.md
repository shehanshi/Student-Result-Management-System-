# 🎓 Student Result Management System

A **Java-based Student Result Management System** demonstrating **OOP concepts** and **design patterns**.


## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Login Validation:** Only student IDs containing `"UWU"` are valid.  
- ✅ **Eligibility Check:** Valid students are checked for exam eligibility.  
- ✅ **Dynamic Student Data:** Fetches student info (Name, Faculty, Degree) from a database.  
- ✅ **GPA Calculation:** GPA calculated per student dynamically.  
- ✅ **Result Reporting:** Generates detailed report with student info and GPA.


## 🛠️ Design Patterns & Principles
- **Chain of Responsibility** – Handles login and eligibility checks sequentially.  
- **Facade** – Simplifies interaction with complex subsystems (student info, GPA, report).  
- **OCP** – Supports multiple GPA calculation methods without modifying existing code.
